# Web Rendering Examples

This repository holds a set of small examples (well, currently just one) using
Elementary Audio in the web browser to build audio applications. Each
subdirectory is itself a standalone web app; step into any given app
subdirectory and check the README for specific instructions or details.

If you're new to Elementary Audio, [**Elementary**](https://elementary.audio) is a JavaScript/C++ library for building audio applications.

* **Declarative:** Elementary makes it simple to create interactive audio processes through functional, declarative programming. Describe your audio process as a function of your application state, and Elementary will efficiently update the underlying audio engine as necessary.
* **Dynamic:** Most audio processing frameworks and tools facilitate building static processes. But what happens as your audio requirements change throughout the user journey? Elementary is designed to facilitate and adapt to the dynamic nature of modern audio applications.
* **Portable:** By decoupling the JavaScript API from the underlying audio engine (the "what" from the "how"), Elementary enables writing portable applications. Whether the underlying engine is running in the browser, an audio plugin, or an embedded device, the JavaScript layer remains the same.

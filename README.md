# Elementary Audio Web Examples

This repository holds a set of small examples (well, currently just one) using Elementary in the web browser to
build various audio applications. Each subdirectory is itself a standalone web app; step into any
given app subdirectory and check the README for specific instructions or details.

## Examples

## What is Elementary?

> Elementary is a JavaScript framework for writing functional, declarative audio applications with a high performance, native audio engine. Elementary aims to lower the barrier to entry into the audio application space, eliminate the gap between prototyping and production, and bring the functional reactive programming model to DSP.
